## 🧠 About the Project

Mental health struggles are common on college campuses, but stigma and fear of judgment keep many students from reaching out. **Aura** removes that barrier entirely — every student gets an anonymous ID (`AURA-2026-XXXX`) instead of a name, so they can take real clinical assessments, talk to an AI companion, log their mood, post in the community, and book a counselor session, all while staying completely unidentifiable to anyone but themselves.

The platform serves three roles:

| Role | Experience |
|------|-----------|
| 🧑‍🎓 **Student** | Anonymous wellness dashboard — assessments, AI chat, mood tracking, games, community, counselor booking |
| 🧑‍⚕️ **Counselor** | Dashboard to view flagged/at-risk students, manage sessions, and join video calls |
| 🛡️ **Admin** | Real-time campus-wide mental health analytics and counselor workload management |

---

## ⭐ Key Highlights

- 🔒 **Fully Anonymous** — Students are identified only by a generated Aura ID; no real names are ever stored or shown
- 📋 **Clinical-Grade Assessments** — Built on **PHQ-9** (depression) and **GAD-7** (anxiety), the same screening tools used by real healthcare providers, with severity scoring (Mild/Moderate/Severe)
- 🤖 **Multilingual AI Companion** — Chat support powered by Llama 3, responding fluently in **English, Hindi, and Marathi**, including code-mixed Hindi-English
- 🚨 **Crisis Detection** — The AI recognizes signs of distress in real time and proactively surfaces a "You Are Not Alone" intervention screen, nudging students toward a real counselor
- 📹 **Live Video Counseling** — One-click video sessions between students and counselors via Jitsi Meet, no app download required
- 📊 **Mood Tracking with Streaks** — Daily mood check-ins visualized as a 7-day trend, with streak tracking to encourage consistency
- 🎮 **Built-in Stress Relief** — Breathing exercises, a memory match game, and a bubble-pop game, all playable directly in-app
- 🩺 **Counselor Triage View** — Counselors instantly see which students need immediate attention, ranked by assessment severity
- 📈 **Live Admin Analytics** — Campus-wide dashboards tracking active students, average PHQ-9/GAD-7 scores, flagged cases, and counselor workload — refreshed in real time
- 🌐 **Peer Community** — Anonymous, topic-tagged posts (Anxiety, Stress, Motivation, Study Tips) where students support each other

```

The React frontend handles all student/counselor/admin UI. The Express backend exposes REST routes for auth, assessments, mood tracking, sessions, and the AI chatbot, storing all data in Supabase under anonymized student IDs. Video sessions are handled via Jitsi Meet links generated per counselor-student pairing.
